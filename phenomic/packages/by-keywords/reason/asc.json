Status](https://travis-ci.org/Astrocoders/bs-reason-apollo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Astrocoders/bs-reason-apollo)\n\nInitially inspired by https://github.com/FormidableLabs/seattlejsconf-app/blob/master/re/types/ReactApollo.re\nBut now with a more sugared usage with function as child.\n\n\n## Difference from reason-apollo official\nThis allows you to use a React Apollo Client that you already have in JS so you can gradually change to Reason.\nSetup the same way you would do for React Apollo and just plug it in.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nyarn add bs-reason-apollo\n```\n\nUpdate your bs-config.json\n```js\n  \"bs-dependencies\": [\"reason-react\", \"bs-reform\", \"bs-reason-apollo\"],\n```\n\n## ReactApollo.CreateWrapper\nAs you have your ApolloProvider somewhere in the top of your React JS tree you are already covered there.\nSo now to use it with Apollo create a query definition module for you query:\n\n```reason\n/* re/SignInQueryGql.re */\nopen BsReasonApollo;\n\nlet query = GraphQLTag.gql({|\n  query SignInQuery {\n    currentUser {\n      id\n      email\n    }\n  }\n|});\n\nmodule Types = {\n  type user = {. \"id\": string, \"email\": string};\n  type error = {. \"message\": string};\n  /* You must always have this data type with loading and error, it's what the HOC gives you */\n  type data = {\n    .\n    \"loading\": Js.boolean,\n    \"error\": Js.null_undefined(error),\n    /* Our response */\n    \"currentUser\": Js.null_undefined(user)\n  };\n};\n\ntype data = Types.data;\n\n/* Define any Js.t variables that you query need here, if you don't use just declare it */\ntype variables;\n\ntype response = Types.user;\n```\n\nNow in your actually component:\n\n```reason\nopen BsReasonApollo;\n\nmodule SignInQueryWrapper = ReactApollo.CreateWrapper(SignInQueryGql);\n\n...\nlet make = (_children) => {\n  ...,\n  render: (_self) =>\n

module:\n\n```reason\n/* re/SignInMutationGql.re */\nopen BsReasonApollo;\n\nlet query = GraphQLTag.gql({|\n  mutation SignInQuery($input: SignInInput!) {\n    signIn(input: $input) {\n      error\n

It has been created with an eye to fully utilize Reason type-system. \nCurrently, only stack-navigation (standard slide from left for iOS and slide from button from Android) is implemented.\nMain problem that we are trying to solve with this is passing props to child components in a straightforward and type-safe way.\n\n## How does it look like?\nThe example app is avaialble at https://github.com/szymonzmyslony/reason-react-native-navigation-exampleApp\n\n\nThis is how this example app looks like:\n![Switch between screens](reason-navigation.gif)\n\nAs you can see the count update (state of the root component) doesn't get rerendered when you click increment or decrement on the second screen. This is the first issue that I will be working on solving.\n\n\n## How to use it (when you want to have a full control over your navigation state)?\nStackNavigator is a functor that expects one type for your navigationState variant:\n```reason\nmodule type Impl = {\n  type navigationState;\n};\n```\n\nThis is how you create a functor:\n\n```reason\nmodule StackNavigator =\n  StackNavigator.Make {\n    type navigationState = screen;\n  };\n```\n\nFor example, in my simple app, I had:\n```reason\ntype screen =\n  | Login\n  | MainScreen\n  | Player int string;\n\n```\nStackNavigator requires navigation state to be managed by parent component. Thus, we need to pass \nnavigation state, pop, and push methods, and two render functions (header and screen). This is how root render in my app looks\nlike:\n```reason\n render: fun {state, update, handle} =>\n    ReasonReact.element @@\n    StackNavigator.make\n      navigationState::state.navigationState\n      goBack::(update pop)\n      getHeaderConfig::headerTitle\n      render::(\n        renderScreen\n          ::handle\n          pop::(update pop)\n          push::(update push)\n          updateProjects::(update updateProjects)\n          projects::state.projects\n      )\n```      \nrenderScreen and render can take any arguments needed from the root of the app and pass it down to other screens:\n```reason\nlet renderScreen\n    pop::(pop: 'a => unit)\n    push::(push: screen => unit)\n    ::projects\n    ::handle\n    ::updateProjects\n    screen =>\n  switch screen {\n  | Login => ReasonReact.element @@ LoginScreen.make ()\n  | Player index _id => DetailViewProject.render project::(List.nth projects index)\n  | MainScreen =>\n    ReasonReact.element @@ MainScreenContainer.make ::push ::updateProjects ::projects\n  };\n\nlet headerTitle screen =>\n  switch screen {\n  | MainScreen => \"Shows\"\n  | _ => \"test\"\n  };\n  ```\n\n  New StatefullStackNavigator module avoid boilerplate for push and pop actions. \n  The example app (https://github.com/szymonzmyslony/reason-react-native-navigation-exampleApp)\n  is showing how to use it. \n\n\n\n","analyzed":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.088Z","updated":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.088Z","stars":20,"score":0,"quality":0,"popularity":0,"maintenance":0,"repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/szymonzmyslony/reason-react-native-navigation","npmUrl":null,"docsUrl":null,"path":"packages/unpublished/szymonzmyslony/reason-react-native-navigation"},{"id":"unpublished/threepointone/bs-nice","filename":"unpublished%2Fthreepointone%2Fbs-nice.json","type":"unpublished","name":"threepointone/bs-nice","version":"0.1.0","description":"css-in-reason","license":"MIT","keywords":["css","bucklescript","reason"],"readme":"(work in progress)\n\n## nice\n\ncss-in-reason. just because.\n\n```reason\nopen Nice;\n\nlet className = css([\n  Display(Flex),\n  AlignItems(Center),\n  Color(Red),\n  Select(\":hover\", [Color(Blue)])\n]);\n```\n\n## some nice features\n\n* pure reason\n* typed css\n* glamor-style composition\n* escape hatch - `Raw(key, value)`\n\n## todo\n\n* keyframes / animations\n* font-faces\n* vendor prefixing\n* better types\n* ~ hot reloading\n* 'server' side\n* benchmarks / tests\n","analyzed":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.127Z","updated":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.127Z","stars":79,"score":0,"quality":0,"popularity":0,"maintenance":0,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/threepointone/bs-nice#readme","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/threepointone/bs-nice","npmUrl":null,"issuesUrl":"https://github.com/threepointone/bs-nice/issues","docsUrl":null,"path":"packages/unpublished/threepointone/bs-nice"},{"id":"unpublished/wokalski/vow","filename":"unpublished%2Fwokalski%2Fvow.json","type":"unpublished","name":"wokalski/vow","version":"0.0.2","description":"Almost sound Promises for Bucklescript","license":"MIT","keywords":["promise","bucklescript","reason"],"readme":"# Vow\n\n`Vow` is a tiny library which allows you to handle promises more safely in your Bucklescript application.\n\nA `Vow` can be either `handled` and `unhandled`. All promises of type `vow 'a handled` make sure that you handled Promise rejections. Thanks to that you will avoid the Uncaught promise error.\n\n## Side effects\n\nAfter series of operations you usually want to \"consume\" a promise. `Vow.sideEffect` should be used for that.\n\nIt only accepts promises which are properly handled.\n\n## Unwrapping\n\nYou can unwrap a handled promise using `Vow.unwrap`.\n\n## Nesting vows\n\n`Js.Promise.t` is unsafe when you nest promises. i.e. `Js.Promise.t (Js.Promise.t 'a)` is unsound. In the runtime it's `Js.Promise.t`.\n\nThis is resolved with `vow`s. If you nest `vow`s they behave as expected.\n\nHowever if you put a `Js.Promise.t` inside a `vow` (which are boxed `Js.Promise.t` under the scenes) you're gonna get a `vow` of the following type:\n\n```reason\n/* in Reason syntax */\n\nvow (Js.Promise.t 'a) 'status\n```\nHowever, under the scenes it'll really be\n\n```reason\n\nvow 'a 'status\n```\n\nTherefore `vow` is not sound.\n\n## Binding\n\nIn order to use vows you have to bind to your existing APIs using `Vow.wrap`/`Vow.unsafeWrap`.\n\nIf you `unsafeWrap` a promise which does throw your code will be unsound.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's see a real world example of vows with some comments:\n\n```reason\nlet login _: Vow.Result.t authenticationState error Vow.handled =>\n  /* Returns a handled Vow.Result.t */\n  Login.logIn () |>\n  /* Validates the returned value.
