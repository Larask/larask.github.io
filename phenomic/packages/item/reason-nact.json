So why are we still programming like it's the 90s?</p>\n<p>Inspired by the approaches taken by Akka and Erlang, nact is an open source Node.js framework which enables you to take control of your state to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>more effectively use memory</li>\n<li>improve application resiliance</li>\n<li>increase performance</li>\n<li>reduce coupling </li>\n</ul>\n<p>With out of the box support for event sourcing, and a considered implementation of the actor model, nact can work across a wide variety of domains.</p>\n<p>Nact is no silver bullet, but it is evolving to tackle ever more demanding use cases. Perhaps one of them is yours?</p>\n<p>To get started, head to <a href=\"https://nact.io\">https://nact.io</a></p>"}
