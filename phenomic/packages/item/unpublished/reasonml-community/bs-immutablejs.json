These are only meant to be used to interoperate with existing JavaScript code; In Reason/BS, we have more lightweight immutable (and optionally mutable) data structures by default (list, record, hashmap, set, and upcoming data structures). New Reason/BS projects projects don't need bs-immutablejs.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe source is a [single file](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-immutablejs/blob/master/src/immJsRe.re) of BuckleScript `external`s. The API corresponds to Immutable.js' API.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```reason\nlet greeting = ImmutableJsRe.List.fromArray([|\"hello\", \"world\"|]);\n\nlet extendedGreeting = ImmutableJsRe.List.push(\"how are you\", greeting);\n\nlet reallyExtendedGreeting =\n  ImmutableJsRe.List.(\n    extendedGreeting |> push(\"I'm fine\") |> push(\"thank you\") |> push(\"and you?\")\n  );\n```\n\nGenerated code:\n\n```js\nvar greeting = Immutable.List(/* array */[\n      \"hello\",\n      \"world\"\n    ]);\nvar extendedGreeting = greeting.push(\"how are you\");\nextendedGreeting.push(\"I'm fine\").push(\"thank you\").push(\"and you?\");\n```\n\n## Transitioning to Idiomatic Reason/BuckleScript Data Structures\n\nHere's a table of Immutable.js data structures and their Reason/BuckleScript equivalents. Reason/BS provide the data structures out of the box.\n\nImmutable.js | Reason/BuckleScript\n----|-----\nList | List\nMap | Map\nOrderedMap | Nothing yet\nSet | Set\nOrderedSet | Nothing yet\nStack | List\nRecord | Record\nSeq | Use `lazy`\n\n## Contributing\n\nPrerequisite: `https://github.com/reasonml/reason-cli`.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-immutablejs.git\ncd bs-immutablejs\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n","analyzed":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.123Z","updated":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.123Z","stars":19,"score":0,"quality":0,"popularity":0,"maintenance":0,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-immutablejs#readme","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-immutablejs","npmUrl":null,"issuesUrl":"https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-immutablejs/issues","docsUrl":null,"path":"packages/unpublished/reasonml-community/bs-immutablejs"}
